# World Weather Analysis

The World Weather Analysis is a user-friendly input system that allows potential travelers to advise their preferred weather conditions. After the user provides their desired temperature travel conditions our data base will auto generate a map that provides the following cities as well as a surrounding radius of hotels within that city that meets the user’s criteria. For example, we have also created an itinerary that displays four different cities that the potential travelers can visually interact with to see all transit options.
