# World Weather Analysis

The World Weather Analysis is a user-friendly input system that allows potential travelers to advise their preferred weather conditions. After the user provides their desired temperature travel conditions our data base will auto generate a map that provides the following cities as well as a surrounding radius of hotels within that city that meets the userâ€™s criteria. For example, we have also created an itinerary that displays four different cities that the potential travelers can visually interact with to see all transit options.
